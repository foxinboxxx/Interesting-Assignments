Algorithmic problem about islands

For a two-dimensional array M x N, consisting of ones that take land and zeros that take water, restore the number of residues.

The island is surrounded by water and is formed by horizontal and vertical junctions of land. You can cover all four water coverage areas.

If there are no note islands, return 0.
